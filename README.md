The class contains a copy (sallow copy) of the `UndoableStringBuilder`. 

ConcreteMember has 2 private variables:
-  `String name` 
- `UndoableStringBuilder usb`

  
in addition, has the following methods:
- `ConcreteMember`
- `update`
- `toString`


### ConcreteMember(String name)
Assigns the name of the member, and creates the UbdoableStringBuilder "usb".

- `GroupAdmin`
- `register`
- `unregister`
- `insert`
- `append`
- `delete`
- `undo`
- `notifyObservers`
- `toString`


### GroupAdmin()
Assigns `usb` and creates the ArrayList `members`.

### register(Member obj)
It used to register observers. each member can register only once! (if he didn't unregister). 

### unregister(Member obj)
It used to unregister observers. each member can unregister only if he already register.
